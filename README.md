Arduino Scoreboard
==================

### Notes ###

- This scoreboard sketch requires the use of seven (7) digital I/O pins.

- The sketch also expects the arduino to run at 16 MHz. 
	- If another clock speed is required, the timer must be adjusted in order to facilitate proper multiplexing of the screens.
